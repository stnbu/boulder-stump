Theirs is a mostly peaceful, shady and verdant world. Bright red-orange stones the size of mountains jut out of the otherwise unbroken green at just the right frequency. The Crec are a sort of "cavemen". This word will be used unironically throughout. It's how they would describe themselves. In fact, they would fit a surprising number of your stereotypes about cavepeople.

You will have seen the movie. They do wear minimal animal hide clothing. Wouldn't you? Would you waste hide? You wouldn't if you were a Crec. They do in fact live in caves. Most of your Hollywood stereotypes are based on what regular, modern humans would invent or do to solve a problem, given only nature's resources; and that is what the Crec do also, unsurprisingly. It's no wonder regular people converge on many of the same solutions over and over again. That's why, say for example, unavoidably having to club a loved one over the head is in fact required on occasion. And have you ever tried to get out of the way of an enraged mother baboon? Sometimes you just grab a handful of hair and run for your life. Yes, there is clubbing. And dragging by the hair.

The stereotypes just keep going. Clever analogs to modern vehicles? No, sadly, but warm, furry backs abound (They ride animals.) However, the distribution of tall, rather neat and symmetrical palm trees, and the way the verge of the nearby lagoon is here and there carpeted with some strikingly uniform and very green grass is just as you are thinking. There /are/ saber-toothed tigers. There are also rather furry (and rather smelly) rhinoceros. It's rather beautiful. The Crec are aware, just as you are, that there is such a thing as timeless beauty.

We will get to dinosaurs. It's complicated.

And pretty much everyone lives in a cave. Let's get that out of the way. What's sometimes not so beautiful is how each opening often looks like a rather droopy upper eyelid the morning after a socially acceptable quantity of good juff. Fire produces smoke, and smoke must go /somewhere/. As the Crec saying goes, "Where there is fire, there is smoke." A bit of light in the early evening is nice. A bit of warmth is even nicer, but not always needed. All year long, fires get used for something or other. And that smoke makes a mess. You would be forgiven if you thought someone was trying to smoke someone else out of their cave. Of course that happens too. Thag's Burrow Buster.

The Zog clan, whom you will soon meet, live in such a cave. A nice cave, for sure. The beautiful multi-orange, irregular cone in which the Zog clan lived was at this point very much hollowed out. It was among the lighter mountains. The same family, all the way back to the times of Grut<footnote #1: the great>, has occupied this hill, which was given the name Bhorv Zolk long ago. The name now has as much meaning to them as it does to you.

A hollowed out rock 167 men tall can be a cozy kind of place. The soot above the openings were in this case considered "quaint", and it gave a place for the grandkids to scratch in their names and draw rock-sticks, with a hasty, pleasurable guilt, followed by a rapid retreat. The soot stains above the opening to the parlor were an especially large, especially shameful bit of soot-pallet. Grandsons Darcc and Dragg were currently hard at work with rhino soap and a basket full of pine cones for scrubbing. Sometimes it's a matter of who gets caught, but sometimes the club of justice falls true.

Fires make for a cozy cave, and the grand matriarch Nud, Zog's seventh and it would turn out final wife, was the artful, watchful, and opinionated keeper of the fires. Usually this /would have/ mean schlepping wood every late evening to the point of exhaustion, and only after this is done would the cleaning, arranging and lighting take place. No longer! Nud was more the managerial type.

She was currently shouting at Grav, Son of Zog, who was taking a well-earned rest in the ancient-speak burrow, sitting on what was agreed by all to be the most comfortable sit-ham-stone. It had several polished areas to prove its merit. Grav was staring at an upside-down river of smoke that gently flowed in its bed of soot, making its way to the /highest/ point, among all the inverted valleys, cliffs and mesas. Grav was ignoring Nud. It seemed like there was sometimes so much passion-inspired noise coming from his stepmother, it really didn't seem worth trying to mine for the gems (or "value-stone", which is used by the Crec in the same way we use the word "gem" sometimes: "I can't seem to find my favorite club anywhere. It was a /real value-stone/!")

Nud continued to nud on, knowing full well Grav's policy on his listening to her. ("Nudding" was an in-joke that of course is not known to Zog's generation, nor to his young, current wife.)

"I will move momentarily /mother/. Father-Brother Verk is not even here yet."

"You'll move now, because I need to clean your nasty stone. Relax-marks are not a thing we show Father-Brother Verk. What do we know they indicate? You know his generation."

"Sloff.", muttered Grav.

"What?"

"/Sloff!/ Do your whatever later. Go away."

Nud grunted elegantly and begin cleaning the area right next to, and indeed underneath Grav's left sit-ham with a crusty, stiff bush-derived broom.

Wordlessly, but with all the feeling he could muster, Grav sprung into to an angry jog towards his burrow. Farting loudly in Nud's direction as he left.

He had had a lot to think about with the "enjoyable" family get-together coming closer every day, and now /here/, on this day. It was a miserable thought. Ancient-speak was just a way to list out the things you were supposed to "think". Grav always thought it was truly strange that so many others seemed to have a completely different definition of "think". To Grav, /think/ meant to take what you've seen, heard, and felt in the past and try to use it as a way to /understand/, which in turn to him meant "to be able to predict". This was a relatively new idea of his, but the more he thought about it, the more sense it made. If something could predict something, it made /sense/. It was worthy of scratching down.

It was all about prediction, in Grav's view. Currently he was working on a predict-tool regarding people's behavior. He several imperfect, but pretty good predict-tools about what things cause different reactions in fellow clan members.

For instance, he said, "the Chief has made a new take-part-money requirement involving the production mill stones" to Gher, an older great cousin. Before doing this, he made sure he remembered what he thought would happen. Grav put in extra effort to make his delivery as believable as possible. As predicted, in about 5 drop-stone, Gher went through phases of rage, disbelief, some kind of forced serenity, and then rage again. Gher would compose a response in his head, make a "pop" sound with his mouth as he began to speak, but then reconsider as another, better thing to say occurred to him. Grav always wondered why he didn't just decide what he was going to say to begin with, and /then/ open his mouth, possibly even without making a sound.

The response that Gher apparently thought of as the winner in this competition of ideas was as follows:

"A take-money on the working Crec is a take-money on productivity! These Forest-Deer Chiefs are just out to make the Elders-Quorum bigger all the time!"

Grav made a gentle, mollifying smile, shook his head slowly, and shrugged. He'd been keeping score of his successes and failures. Decidedly a success, this one. His head immediately went to the question of how he would /know/ that. Maybe by the time he walked to his burrow and scratched in this result, his memory of what had happened would be shaped by something along the way. What if one of Gher's daughters had tried to jump-scare him on his way. He did not care for those girls, and he blamed Gher for the kind of people they turned out to be, so far. Who else to blame, the child? Father-Brother Verk would think so. Beat the food-clay out of a disappointing child, repeat until results emerge.

And by the name of After-Die-Monster, signs of Father-Brother Verk's nearing made it to Grav's ears.

"He comes! Verk, Son of Jik and his party have been seen moving through Monkey-Tail Pass.", an anonymous clan member shouted just as a general announcement.

That would mean another sun-palm at most.

Grav retired to his burrow, to think about things.

---

Father-Brother Verk, Son of Jik had been sitting in the ancient-speak burrow accepting polite, and completely obligatory offers of refreshment, with forced modesty. 

Today Verk would tell all those who gathered (again, compulsory) in the ancient-speak burrow of The Battle of the Snake Meal during The Great Club War and the profound life lessons learned therein.

"Shall we all be quiet and let you begin Father-Brother Verk, Son of Jit?", one of the several-finger caveladies doting over him.

"Oh, well. I just." Verk noisily deposited a healthy quantity of bird-scat into a finely woven, and yet unavoidably course rag. "Whaaaa... Dortyses!!", he wailed at the ceiling as he sneezed. Verk had a severe allergy to a very poisonous flowering plant that more or less reproduced continuously.

"I'll get started. Thank you, rhino-calf."

Verk shifted his weight from one sit-ham to the other in his chair in a way that somehow expressed contempt for everyone in the room. It was rumored that he's had a progressively worsening case of between-ham-fire-pebbles for generations.
