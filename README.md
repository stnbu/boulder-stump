### Ado

Welcome to my terrible web page about my awesome book entitled, ***Gog
Said "Boulder-Stump"***

It\'s silly. *I* am silly. Relax, bro. We all need a good mocking.

Doing my honest level best to be objective and calibrated about my own
abilities, I would say that this book is various parts of\...

-   Discworld
-   Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy
-   Galaxy Quest
-   Full Metal Jacket
-   Clan of the Cave Bear
-   Caveman (1981)
-   Monty Python
-   American History X

You get it. Nothing special.

`ðŸš§add summary here1ðŸš§`\
So far I\'ve just been spraying out other content. Will get around to
it. And a proper *preface*, probably. And all kinds of restructuring.

A GitHub repo that corresponds more or less to this content is
[here](https://github.com/stnbu/boulder-stump). And I totally will
*totally* take rock-stick pull requests. I\'ll make all kinds of
opinionated changes until it\'s unrecognizable, take credit for it, and
definitely remember to thank you.

I guess it\'s a \"living document\". May there not be a bunch of idiotic
controversy about \"Chapter II\".

I also have a lot of terrifically random content
[here](https://mburr.bearblog.dev/blog/),
[here](https://www.publish0x.com/@captainmidday) and
[here](https://www.reddit.com/user/captainmidday). Judge not, lest I
un-friend you and sulk!
