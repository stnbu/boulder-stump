<p>
Club-drill was excruciating to the Grav and Gog in ways that they couldn't manage to communicate to others. It was mostly about being told what to do and being criticized by the ignorant and linear thinkers that were inevitably the "top bronze"; often criticized for doing exactly what you were told to do.
</p>

<p>
Another concept they wouldn't be able to explain or even be aware exists was "selection bias". It's a subtle idea. It would be a while before that one got identified and tagged.
</p>

<p>
In words that a Crec might understand: The cavemen who made their way to the top in the hierarchy were the type who really liked bossing people about. They were cavemen who were violently uninterested in the wisdom of their plans for <i>you</i>.
</p>

<p>
Given enough cavemen, you will find some outliers. You may not know anyone who likes to give orders, doesn't like to be questioned, and doesn't care whether they are "right" by <i>your</i> definition, but how many CO's<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> does one need? Not many. And being the scrappy sort they will, in stages, work their way toward their dream job. Everyone should. Recruiting was no small part of the Armed-Forest. Outreach, recruitment and other kinds of advertising paid off in their growth, and in the recruitment of many particular <i>types</i> to fill corresponding <i>roles</i>.
</p>

<p>
As a Crec you could and probably would some day be drafted. But to make a career out of it was a different tack. If drafted and not a CO, you pretty much spent all your time either killing, being killed, or learning to kill. CO's were more the managerial type.
</p>

<p>
And since your fate was to be involved in all this anyway, <i>completely voluntary</i> "club-drills" were regularly held in locations around the Forest. If bloody combat was going to inevitably happen, one may as well be among the best-prepared.
</p>

<p>
You may have stopped and wondered yourself: What was it like to be among a sea of men on opposing "teams", all literally in a life-or-death fight with both sharp and blunt weapons of war, <i>right there in front of you</i>, wanting to kill you. And you wanting to kill <i>them</i> because of that fact. It's an unimaginably frightening thought when it's both real and likely. Try and touch that kind of terror in yourself. See if you can imagine yourself in that terrifying bloody mess: This is what motivated Grav and Gog to trek all this way, all-too-regularly.
</p>

<p>
The clubbing-camps were usually overseen by some Great Bear war hero. "Choh-Ov", the camp nearest Bhorv Zolk was run by Verk. The title of this role, the camp head, was Mother Bear<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. Verk was Choh-Ov's Mother Bear.
</p>

<p>
Fayt-Caves, which entirely surrounded Choh-Ov, was a shanty town, but carved out of rock, which really looks nicer than shanty any way you cut it. Fayt-Caves was seedy, crime-ridden, full of loud parties on an ongoing basis, had an entire district devoted to hire-baby-makers and their trade. Choh-Ov was more or less the yolk of this sad, desperate fried egg.
</p>

<p>
And it was small-knowledge<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> that this was the norm: Surrounding more or less every clubbing-camp in the Forest and its protectorates was a 'bad neighborhood' by most definitions. No one thought this amiss. It was never questioned<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Grav and Gog had decided to leave the day after the revelation of Ender's-Sword, giving them the opportunity to take make a leisurely day of it. They only needed to cover one and one half of one all-finger palm<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> of pretty standard jungle, woods, and scrubby savanna; the way well-traveled and therefore clearly marked, well serviced by vendors, and safe-with-many. They had even let themselves sleep in a bit<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>. Since the final part of the journey crossed a wide, flat, scrubby plain and the moon was sufficiently bright, they would be able to travel for hours after dark set in.
</p>

<p>
In the worst case, they planned to bivouac one night, wake up early and arrive at Choh-Ov before conch.
</p>

<p>
As Bhorv Zolk faded into the distance, the path to the morning-sun-left-back-side<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup> was gently rolling hills and low shrubs for a palm or more. Bhorv Zolk could be seen fading into the distance, which was a nice way to say goodbye to home. One got a feeling that it was very big, being visible from all this way, and would therefore surely be there when you got back<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Gog hummed, whistled, yipped, and struck various parts of his body, making a sort of improvised song.
</p>

<p>
"Feedback" of any kind between the two men usually took the form of cutting, merciless criticism from one toward the other. In a way, it was their stick<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9">9</a></sup>. Grav withheld his commentary on Gog's music. Grav would never say such out loud, but Gog was definitely quite talented as a song-maker.
</p>

<p>
He'd tried working on convincing Gog to have a visit with Snogny-Dodk, the music-scratcher nearest Bhorv Zolk. Business was good, and all manner of copy-protection<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10">10</a></sup> schemes were the key to success, Snogny-Dodk knew<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11">11</a></sup>. He had a regular rotation of all-finger-and throat-and-drum-choirs that would snare<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12">12</a></sup> his most profitable demographic: all-finger-and boys trying to woo their crush by performing some music or other, using <i>his</i> scratching standards and training system.
</p>

<p>
Selling the materials needed to perform a cover of the latest hit was really all there was in the music business, outside of performing of course, for which you would need security and acoustical expertise.
</p>

<p>
Knowing that he would get no movement from Gog, who liked to play friendly-decorator-bird<sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13">13</a></sup>, Grav decided to just enjoy the well selected traveling music and think a squirrel-hoard about how to best navigate the next few days. This was just baseline thinking-ahead for him. Nothing was worrying him in particular.
</p>

<p>
Would word about their find have made its way yet? Not feeling any particular need to be there, Verk, whose methods were not questioned, would not be at the camp. He would make his way back eventually, at his own pace, likely after Grav and Gog had gone. Verk, retinue, and Under-Men would not have returned to Fayt-Caves yet.
</p>

<p>
Verk could easily send a message. He probably had, given that he was now, to none of their surprise, going to wrap himself all the around this<sup><a id="fnr.14" class="footref" href="#fn.14">14</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
xxx we use Under-Men to both mean "verk's thugs" and "the learned men in the ancient-speak burrow"&#x2026; must untangle. xxx
</p>

<p>
And even if none of that, there was a regular flow of traffic to and from Fayt-Caves; men attending club-drill, general commerce, or newly-married baby-makers relocating to their new home<sup><a id="fnr.15" class="footref" href="#fn.15">15</a></sup>. The traffic was always "very light". You might see three or four other parties over two nights. The parties might be of size one or all-finger all-finger. In certain seasons, you might encounter no one.
</p>

<p>
It was hard to say, in other words.
</p>

<p>
A few palm outside of Fayt-Caves, Verk owned what would be considered a castle almost universally; a point that the men would pass late that evening, if they kept their pace.
</p>

<p>
"Would word of the Ender's-Sword have made it to Choh-Ov?", Grav wondered allowed.
</p>

<p>
Without breaking his stride, Gog abruptly stopped his music and looked at Grav, possibly thinking, or possibly for superb comedic timing.
</p>

<p>
"You mean Ender's-Stump?"
</p>

<p>
Grav's run became a staggering, rhythmic stomp as he laughed maniacally while continuing to run. He eventually gave up on that and let himself fall into an enormous dark-purple heather shrub. He continued to laugh face-down at the dirt and detritus at the ancient shrub's base. Through his teary eyes he noticed an earthworm escaping downwards, away from him.
</p>

<p>
He eventually righted himself, making a lot of noise as he pushed himself up, snapping small branches and spitting out a sparse cloud of tiny purple petal glitter and twigs that had ended up in his open mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Scout<sup><a id="fnr.16" class="footref" href="#fn.16">16</a></sup>, you need to lay off of that stuff! Not everyone is as mirth-filled as us, you know. The Forest Executioners are not known for their stoatishness<sup><a id="fnr.17" class="footref" href="#fn.17">17</a></sup>.", said Grav.
</p>

<p>
"Eegh. I'm tired of worrying about it, to be frank." Gog was such an artist with his banana-language that he was no longer entertained by it, and so was laughing not at all. It seemed like he just thought of it as his 'job'; trudging through another day of saying things that caused others to nearly have a stroke with hilarity. "You know either of us could be dead tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
"Yeah, but probably not <i>from torture</i>.", reasoned Gog.
</p>

<p>
"I mean, yeah, of course I will always take reasonable precautions. But mount it, it becomes so much of a drain on me to constantly have to edit my words, that I'm willing to be a bit 'strategically reckless' in order to just relax for a <i>sewing</i> change!!" Gog seemed to be shaking his head in disgust. "Also, always feeling like I want to live another day so that I can say as much banana as I want is its own kind of motivation to not get cheeped on<sup><a id="fnr.18" class="footref" href="#fn.18">18</a></sup>."
</p>

<p>
"There's some motivation.", pondered Grav.
</p>

<p>
"And they <i>are</i> just words, aren't they?", he continued, now sharing some of Gog's annoyance at the arbitrariness of it all, though he was not yet an angry rebel like Gog. "It angers me too. Some things are at the same time both infuriatingly stupid and unjust, while at the same time being completely small-knowledge to seemingly everyone. Everyone gets so clubby<sup><a id="fnr.19" class="footref" href="#fn.19">19</a></sup> about <i>language</i>."
</p>

<p>
Grav continued. "Did you know that in Douks you can have three toenails pulled out for underpaying your take-value? Regardless of circumstances? At least the Crec haven't gone that crazy.
</p>

<p>
If you find something in the jungle of any value at all, the Douks Forest has a 'claim' on half of it, without any kind of justification. It's just <i>theirs</i> and that's that!
</p>

<p>
How would you take-value half of one Ender's-Stump?"
</p>

<p>
Gog's cheeks tightened with the suppression of a smile.
</p>

<p>
"What has that got to do with what we're talking about?", asked Gog.
</p>

<p>
"Strain is strain, whether it's about taking value or removing freedom.
</p>

<p>
In a way, they're similar things; freedom and value. You can use your freedom to get value. Taking away your freedom is like taking value you don't yet have, because 'they' have wrecked your plans. Maybe <i>you</i> want to be a professional banana-talker and charge value for your performances&#x2026;!"
</p>

<p>
Both men snickered cynically while also thinking, <i>that'd be a cool job!</i>
</p>

<p>
Gog answered with a question, while smirking gratefully. "Are we really gonna trek it out the whole way through, without a bivouac?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not? So long as we hit Snare Plains by maybe one palm after sundown, we'll be set like a murderous monkey<sup><a id="fnr.20" class="footref" href="#fn.20">20</a></sup>."
</p>

<p>
"That's three palm of walking in the dark in Small Woods."<sup><a id="fnr.21" class="footref" href="#fn.21">21</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
"Less than <i>one and one half</i> of one palm, and <i>running</i>!", corrected Grav helpfully.
</p>

<p>
Much later, it getting dark and their nearing the end of Small Woods, they encountered a forest-child<sup><a id="fnr.22" class="footref" href="#fn.22">22</a></sup> whose path was intersecting with the only established trail for several palm, as seems always to be the case with the forest-children, and only in the Forest; <i>any</i> Forest, really, but not on a plain for example.
</p>

<p>
"Greetings cheerful fellow traveler!", said Grav loudly, there never having been any sense of fear about them from anyone that he could recall, and Grav anticipating a reliably predictable sequence of events to follow.
</p>

<p>
Grav knew his opening comment would be ignored for signs of "foreignness", far from having fact that they were speaking separate languages considered, and also knowing he would not be able to make anything of the traveler's response.
</p>

<p>
The bulk of these encounters were eerily similar to one another, and each time it seemed they had to build their pantomime vocabulary with them from scratch. But they were practiced, and both men knew in any case, they'd have to get through the first, rather long part where the forest-child is unaware they do not understand.
</p>

<p>
And for all anyone could tell, a forest-child <i>was</i> a child. It was astonishing. No matter how hard anyone had tried, they couldn't make out any dwarfish features. Other than often being scarred and every so often missing fingers, teeth, eyes, or limbs, and but for toned muscles under the leathery, tough skin, they were what we moderns would call "toddlers".
</p>

<p>
They did not know Crecspeak or anything remotely like it, but were evidently fluent in some kind of language. The small boy<sup><a id="fnr.23" class="footref" href="#fn.23">23</a></sup> slouched in a way that a very relaxed, fit, successful older caveman would; a standing slouch that said he could take them or leave them. Or possibly even kill them. But he showed no sense of fear or hatred, just casual toddlerness. They smoked a pipe in about half the cases. This one was not a partaker<sup><a id="fnr.24" class="footref" href="#fn.24">24</a></sup>. He currently stood with the sole of one foot resting on the calf of the other leg, with his spear, at least three times his height stuck in the ground and currently serving as just a staff to lean on, ever casually.
</p>

<p>
And predictably, from appearances, the toddler had not yet considered that the two men might not understand his language. He paused very briefly on occasion in a way that suggested he was baffled by the lack of a response, but continued on just the same.
</p>

<p>
After an especially baffling non-response, Grav took the initiative to blow away his new friend with some casual, pithy, fluently spoken Crec utterances<sup><a id="fnr.25" class="footref" href="#fn.25">25</a></sup>; asking all kinds of questions about who cleaned him after scat time, where was this crazy toddler kingdom located, did he live in a mushroom, and aside from one's thumb, what kind of things were out there in the woods to suck on for an active baby like himself.
</p>

<p>
The light of understanding, forgiveness, and kindness toward new friends dawned on the toddler's honest face. He bowed slightly, showing who-knows-what to the woods behind him.
</p>

<p>
He made a lot of "we friends" gestures with his hands, his heart, and his mostly toothless smile. Grav and Gog mimicked the ones they felt pretty sure about.
</p>

<p>
Grav turned to Gog. "How is your forest-child-babble?"
</p>

<p>
Gog said, "More importantly what do we want to ask him. He's full of helpful answers, all written in High Ancient Balrag. What can we get out of him—then maybe see if he jumps for joy at a polished uvula."
</p>

<p>
Grav looked at the sky through the canopy and thought for a considerable while.
</p>

<p>
"Ok. Translator, ask him if he would chance the remainder of the Little Woods at a leisurely walk on our way to Snare Plain, or would he run like scat?", Grav said to Gog.
</p>

<p>
"Oh. Thanks for starting with an easy one."
</p>

<p>
The woods, especially near the planes, were a lively hunting ground just as soon as it was dark enough; for all kinds of big, bigger-than-you things made from muscle, teeth and claws. The plain, being a safer place at night, generally; just keep pace and make a lot of noise, you rarely got messed with.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think that'd be handy to know?"
</p>

<p>
"If we were that worried, we'd be running right now."
</p>

<p>
While the men were talking, the forest-child made a series of gestures. "Warning" and "no" and "great death" could be seen on his countenance as he made his interpretive dance.
</p>

<p>
"Flying?", Gog thought picked up.
</p>

<p>
"Mouth? Beak?", Grav tried to help, in this elite-level version of Pictionary, where the audience is more or less dumb, at least from the forest-child's perspective.
</p>

<p>
"Is that a tail? Egg?"
</p>

<p>
"Lizard bird?", asked Grav.
</p>

<p>
"I'm pretty sure he is saying lizard-bird something. Egg&#x2026;could it be eating for two and therefore especially hungry?", asked Gog to Grav, but while making intense eye contact with the forest-child.
</p>

<p>
His feedback from the toddler was a shrug. Grav made a "big eat-y beak" gesture with his two outstretched arms, perhaps with fingers playing the roll of some hooked teeth at the tips.
</p>

<p>
The toddler's eyes made saucers. He pointed at Grav and jumped rapidly with bent knees, his torso more or less stationary, as one might at the height of a Pictionary nail-biter.
</p>

<p>
Lizard-bird could and would kill men. There was no scooping up in the beak and swallowing whole. No, that would be a better fate. Someone from theirs and others' childhood shared-experience was quite impactful in their respect for lizard-bird.

<div id="outline-container-org467447a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org467447a">Caveman Thag</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org467447a">
<p>
One rare survivor, beginning generations ago and up to the present day<sup><a id="fnr.26" class="footref" href="#fn.26">26</a></sup> would enthusiastically, and quite regularly share his story just for the greater good of the Forest<sup><a id="fnr.27" class="footref" href="#fn.27">27</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
He had a kind of "speaking tour". <i>Stay Low to Scrub</i> and its rejoinder, shouted by his audience, <i>Stay Low to Mud</i> were the two catchy phrases by which he was known. In other words: Hide, get out of the way [of the stalking lizard-bird]!
</p>

<p>
Thag could not speak in a way that would be practical for audiences or scratchers-of-new-things<sup><a id="fnr.28" class="footref" href="#fn.28">28</a></sup>. He could make himself understood to the empathetic and patient, of whom he wished he had a few more.
</p>

<p>
In his place a man gifted with a loud, engaging, homely voice, who was made as invisible as possible and standing in the most inconspicuous place possible, would make the theater thunder with the confidence of sound lessons learned.
</p>

<p>
Thag made no effort to move his mouth. He just stood there and made himself heard as if by magic, effortlessly. He would perform very regular, practiced motions at certain points in the long monologue. He was on-cue always.
</p>

<p>
He would tour any demographic that would benefit, which would most of all be children. They would gather around him as he stood center stage, or whatever served in its place.
</p>

<p>
He would scare kids straight about lizard-bird awareness.
</p>

<p>
The voice of Thag began:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Kids, as you know, my name is Thagalonious Son of Reganold, but you kids know me as Caveman Thag!
</p>

<p>
And I am so happy to be here. I want to tell you kids about how to be safe, and what to look out for when being lizard-bird-aware!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The kids shout aimlessly but with enthusiasm.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Many of you know some of my story, but I'm going to lay it out right here, like a slain lizard-bird, so you can learn from me. Okaay!?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The kids shout again, and Thag points to the ground with his only arm on which there are really only two <i>sorts</i> of fingers.
</p>

<p>
More or less appropriate, but sometimes vague gestures came from Thag in time with certain parts of the story.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I say 'Stay Low to Scrub', and <i>you</i> say&#x2026;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
"<b><b>Stay! Low! to! Mud!</b></b>"
</p>

<p>
Thag smiled with satisfaction which, with his lower lip missing, was quite a smile indeed.
</p>

<p>
Thag's thunderous borrowed voice continued as Thag made a kind of one-armed shrug.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Well</i>&#x2026; I was walk home from J'anz-Caves along the path that many of you know well, it's not close to here, but it's close enough. Many of you have seen it in person. It was along The Great Hummingbird Trail, which connects J'anz-Caves, the starting point of my trek to Prominence-Caves, where my parents and I lived at the time. As you know, this is all way down at the far morning-sun-right-side of our Forest.
</p>

<p>
We have Balrag for neighbors, so we know a lot about getting along and also about surviving. They're good cavepeople.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The children did not yet know that they should sneer at this. Some adults snickered, approving the implied nod to small-knowledge.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I was minding my own business. I was on my third night, about half way through, as I had to go all that way to make it home after The Season of Industry<sup><a id="fnr.29" class="footref" href="#fn.29">29</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
It was not especially bright out that night, as there was only a sliver of moon. The stars where bright where they shone, but there were as much cloudy sky as not, lots of burrows of sky for a big, mean bird to stay out of view; say, just until the last moment&#x2026;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The children said little but some seemed to be crawling backward using their arms as they sat on the floor; some able to hover their folded legs along like an accomplished yogi.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I knew that a lizard-bird included this bit of path in its territory. Stories had been going around both caves<sup><a id="fnr.30" class="footref" href="#fn.30">30</a></sup>. And, remember this, in a woods thick enough to block the sky, a lizard-bird is always scanning the openings.
</p>

<p>
In the case of the Crec Forest Roads, that make use of so many straight paths, a bird can choose to fly along a straight course scanning, for snacks, for palm at a time, without having to change course. For a lizard-bird, this is a kind of rest. Know that your attacker will have been fully rested.
</p>

<p>
You my little ones, are just about snacked sized.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thag made swatting motions with his one arm. Involuntarily jiggling finger-stumps, while not adding any meaning, did add to the overall horror of the gesture.
</p>

<p>
Calling it quits at this point, a quiet-one stepped all over the neighbors behind her; faces, groins, where ever her powerful little hard feet landed. Her brother, having been priming her with fear for days, knew just how to nudge her over the edge from sane calculation and obedience straight into mindless, desperate flight, in this case with a well-timed jab to the ribs.
</p>

<p>
Most boys laughed. Otherwise there was not much of a ruckus this scare around.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It was known then, and it is known still that these are the most hazardous. As cloud cover can give you a false set of ease, which we now know is completely unjustified!<sup><a id="fnr.31" class="footref" href="#fn.31">31</a></sup> I was quite at ease, and walking in the middle of the path.
</p>

<p>
Kids, I was counting on the clouds to protect me! We know that's wrong. What do we say about clouds and lizard-bird safety?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This time, the knowing audience chanted along with Thag as he waived out the syllables.
</p>

<p>
"<b><b><i>Don't Let Clouds Fool Ya!</i></b></b>"
</p>

<p>
It was simple and memorable. That was the point. <i>Some of the adults in the audience had difficulty with plenty of ideas of comparable complexity.</i> Thag thought.
</p>

<p>
Thag made a practiced, convincing lizard-bird screech<sup><a id="fnr.32" class="footref" href="#fn.32">32</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
As was always the case with large, temperamental crowds of human children, some added to the known scat-zones, crawling away unembarrassed. The loud, stunning screech was a crowd-pleaser. The scat-er was immediately giggling and dancing soon enough. As the performance went on, feces became ever less a concern for enraptured Caveman Thag audiences.
</p>

<p>
And children were hopeless in communicating something like what they had just experienced.
</p>

<p>
They could excitedly talk to their friends in other parts, relaying the excitement, pandemonium, the once-in-life experiences like seeing a living man so deformed as Thag, and on rare occasions they might share an important lesson learned.
</p>

<p>
Children frequently got a wave of buzz ahead of Thag's visits. But no one was ever prepared for the first screech.
</p>

<p>
This was always a genuine surprise and Thag loved it. Thag worried about everyone's loyalty and intentions, but Voice-Maker Jurd was a value-stone in the value he brought, Thag had to admit. He had both the booming voice of authority and the screech of crazed terror.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I would only very rarely think about danger, walk to the side under the canopy, or turn my head in case I'm both very unlucky and lucky.
</p>

<p>
But I was not usually even this careful.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Jurd knew to watch Thag carefully at this point, using his master's subtle cues to decide when to resume, beginning the real drama in Thag's story.
</p>

<p>
He began again in what stood in for a "quiet" voice in the enormous hillside theater. Jurd was skilled at the seemingly impossible; whispering such that it could be heard one half of one palm away.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Then it came.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There was a random unaccountable juvenile snicker.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
I am unable to puzzle together any of what took place behind me of course, as I was walking in my own little world at night in the woods, lost in thought; an older all-finger-and boy who could kick some ham on the monkey-ground<sup><a id="fnr.33" class="footref" href="#fn.33">33</a></sup>, but was no match for a lizard-bird.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thag always had legitimate lament he could tap into at any time to bring the mood of the house back down to "somber". It was actually something that could be "tapped" in kind of the same way a keg of champagne can be: Carefully; sometimes, often, disastrously. You could end up with more champagne than you anticipated. At this he was truly practiced, for if his cues changed in ways that were hard for Jurd to read, the performance suffered.
</p>

<p>
But it was true that Thag was afraid of lizard-bird still, in a way that makes your arachnophobia seem well-considered and rational.
</p>

<p>
This time too, Thag had to snap out of it and continued his outreach in the most productive way possible, as always.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I was tackled from behind in a way that felt like being stabbed from behind by seven or eight blunt but sharp obsidian blades somehow wielded by a massive speeding boulder of warmth, muscle, and sparse, downy feathers; this only the beginning of its horror.
</p>

<p>
He rode me like a hill-sled for probably four man. Talons squeezing as we slid. By the time we stopped. I felt like I had been wrapped in obsidian-vine<sup><a id="fnr.34" class="footref" href="#fn.34">34</a></sup>, with someone wrapping it ever-tighter. You don't know what it feels like to be mercilessly <i>squeezed</i> by something so terrible&#x2026;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thag trailed off, eyes empty. The children continued to watch until he shook himself and continued.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It was standing on top of me. And it was <i>heavy</i>. It was at least a good sized hyena's weight. As I struggled in a way only one in that situation can truly struggle, it would lift me about a palm with its wings, and then <i>slam</i> me against the ground with all of its weight, making the talons as secure as possible&#x2026; <i>in me</i>!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The speaker paused only briefly this time.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Once it was sure it had a good hold of me, I guess it wanted to make sure I was as dead as possible so I wouldn't be much trouble on the flight home, wherever that was. To this end he pecked me in the head repeatedly. I turned my head so he would be unable to peck the same place twice, if possible, and twisted all around to try and keep the blows from landing as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
And indeed that's where the first gap in my memory lives, although I'm able to fill it with all kinds of nightmares, and sometimes do. Don't lament small game<sup><a id="fnr.35" class="footref" href="#fn.35">35</a></sup>, kids.
</p>

<p>
When I came back around the first time, it was because he was slowing his flight to set me on his perch. It was a scat and bone covered fortress of sorts. It was clear that she<sup><a id="fnr.36" class="footref" href="#fn.36">36</a></sup> and she alone lived there. It was literally in the clouds so I only had the slightest idea, at least initially, of where I was and what was going on any more than all-finger man away.
</p>

<p>
I would soon find out. He started eating me at this point.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The children's only reaction to this was to stare.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Birds naturally go after the softer parts. And since all of my might was tied up in protecting my eyes<sup><a id="fnr.37" class="footref" href="#fn.37">37</a></sup>, he had mostly free reign over my groin parts.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The children didn't move, especially the boys.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I switched from protecting my eyes to protecting my groin as fast as I was able, but the bird had every possible advantage over me.
</p>

<p>
He took up <i>all</i> of my parts and then some, squeezed with his mighty beak and pulled. Of course he had flipped me over at this point and was putting new holes in my front half.
</p>

<p>
For him it truly was effortless. The shock and horror I was experiencing at the moment was a kind of protection for me. I don't know how the reflect-soul works, but I can recall no pain at all.
</p>

<p>
I just remember how effortlessly he tore off what to me was the most important part of my body at the time. It was like the meat had been scored deeply in advance. It just came right off and went down his throat, her making a whole-body bob as he she tossed it down her own throat.
</p>

<p>
The wet sound of her feeding is something that stays with me. You don't think of what it might sound like. You don't get a chance to find out, unless you are unlucky-lucky<sup><a id="fnr.38" class="footref" href="#fn.38">38</a></sup> like me.
</p>

<p>
I could hear important parts of me going down her throat with a gulp.
</p>

<p>
The parts you see missing here are the parts she took.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thag took some time in relishing another of his popular theatrics. He raised his one arm and blindly hopped in a circle, one of his thighs being about half as big around as the other. One ham mostly missing, and a dripping mess of leisurely, gravity-fed feces downward from where his anus used to be. Although no one ever made the connection and Thag was definitely not always a mess like this, in this case like in many other cases, Jurd had done the lizard-bird cry in the same way he had done it literally thousands of times, and this time too, Jurd scared the scat out of him with just a small tweak of timing.
</p>

<p>
He completed his circle and made another famous Caveman Thag smile.
</p>

<p>
Those in the first few rows could see tears coming from the outside of one of his empty, the only bit of tear duct-work to survive intact. The dripping had little correlation with Thad's mood. No one including himself knew they why or when of his tears.
</p>

<p>
Some children giggled. Thag made an oddly raptor-like grabbing motion in the sound's direction; a sort of friendly and oddly raptor-like wave, to a perfectly normal child from a horribly disfigured, ancient man.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I had accepted that some time soon, I would fall asleep from all the blood loss and soon after die. It would be peaceful enough an end, I was unable to feel any pain at the time and felt like all this was happening to someone else.
</p>

<p>
Just then there was a "whoosh" like a cold wave of wind coming down a long, flat slope, along with a slight flash of gray over the whole rocky cliff side. I could tell it was something fast and enormous and of course I was right in guessing that it was another lizard-bird, snake-meal apparent in its middle, wanting to steal a fresh, juicy, living prize away from its tormentor.
</p>

<p>
I knew it was just making a first pass. This could only improve my situation, but in my hopelessness I was unable to feel anything in an emotional way.
</p>

<p>
That was the only exploratory pass it was to make. In the middle of my hazy awareness on this hazy mountain, I was suddenly flung, like a rock from a sling.
</p>

<p>
What I think had happened is this fast, competing bird had more or less tackled the one that was in the middle of eating me, causing it to tumble, where it released me on the up swing, mid-tumble.
</p>

<p>
I feel like I floated in the air for palm. When I finally landed, it was with a gentle "puff" rather than a jarring splat like I had expected, though not expected to notice.
</p>

<p>
I had landed in a man-deep, ancient bed of scab-moss that had been accumulating on that misty hillside probably for all-finger all-finger all-finger years.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The children, knowing a thing or two about cave medicine, gave a tempered cheer, for they knew of the healing properties of scab-moss, and they were just the thing for such injuries<sup><a id="fnr.39" class="footref" href="#fn.39">39</a></sup>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
No one, my self included could make any kind of meaningful guess as to how long I lay there. I of course was not there to count the suns.
</p>

<p>
I will say that when I finally got back, <i>before</i> the many moons of rest with the tender care of my made-me mother, I had been gone for all-finger and seven days. The parts that I can remember probably only add up to a few days. I suspect it had just rained and misted so much in that soggy mass that I drank up moisture through my skin and so did not develop a thirst.
</p>

<p>
I had to have been there, slowly recovering in that massive bed of moss for five or seven days, with no food, water or awareness.
</p>

<p>
And it was cold. Never freezing, but cold. I believe my body was also preserved because the cold slowed down its corruption, like when fresh meat is found early spring.
</p>

<p>
I was just a hopeless husk of a caveman. When I was able to, using only down-power and a lot of wiggling, start my descent, towards what or who, I had no idea. I was existing as a beetle exists<sup><a id="fnr.40" class="footref" href="#fn.40">40</a></sup>. I was just mindlessly surviving.
</p>

<p>
At some point I was lucky enough to wiggle my way into a brook that I had heard getting nearer for many palm. I fell face first and immediately began to slurp. I slurped until I was full, and then slurped some more, I would sometimes throw up half, but start drinking right away again just the same, for blood comes from water and I had lost most.
</p>

<p>
Gritty survival like that is something that surely all of you will eventually experience in your life. It is an inevitability. But it needn't be encountered aimlessly. Learn from me, children.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thag's tale continued with mood-lightening material and some mostly unproductive question and answer time at the very end.
</p>

<p>
He had worked his way down the mountainside, for it was a very high mountain, and going where ever down-power took him, he encountered people. Those people nursed him for many moon, all the while being unable to communicate with him, and his family having no idea what had happened to their Thag all the while.
</p>

<p>
Thereafter you already know the story.
</p>

<p>
This is how Thag and Jurd ended today's telling:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Children I feel I have been blessed by The Ender-of-Questions in a way that is so direct and obvious to me, its will has been clearly revealed to me.
</p>

<p>
My purpose in life is to protect children from danger, and because this burden was forced upon me, I <i>know</i> lizard-bird. I know them. I want you to make sure that you <i>learn</i> something today. Don't be afraid, but don't be foolish!
</p>

<p>
And <i>Stay low to Scrub!</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
"<b><b><i>Stay Low to Mud!!</i></b></b>"
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Kids, don't forget to pick up your free toys and ask as many questions you like of our volunteers!!
</p>

<p>
Thag made his most enthusiastic wave goodbye. His one arm being a disproportionate part of his body's mass, when compared to most. He almost made a flippy-flop with both the upper and lower halves, all the while grinning ghoulishly.
</p>

It comes from the observation that a monkey that has killed one of its own kind and is relaxing in its nest eating the corpse has a look of complete contentment, as though knowing this once-in-life indulgence may or may not shortly cost him <i>his</i> life, or maybe ostracization, sometimes even with a bloody smile that humans easily pick up on. 'Get while the getting is good!', the monkey might say, smacking the words with blood.</p></div></div>

That was astonishingly old for a caveman. Thag was cared for at first only by a loving and tight-knit, but heartbroken family. As his fame grew, his circle of caretakers grew wider. Thag himself was only just barely able to speak in a comprehensible manor, even if only slowly, close up and in person. He could make a word here and there. Crecspeak had an incredible number of words composed of only unvoiced consonants and clicks. Choosing his words with skill allowed him to communicate further. Of course there was a growing vocabulary of signs, but it was all so frustratingly limited. As such, Thag felt in a few cases that he was being growingly surrounded by people who didn't always go to a lot of trouble to <i>fully</i> understand what he was trying to say.</p></div></div>

How they would be able to "see through" clouds was something no one could even present a theory for. But clear day or not, someone would eventually witness the bleating goat get in a drop-stone by a bomb dropping out of the sky, which was especially dramatic on overcast days when it was entirely unknown whether there was even a bird up there.</p></div></div>

The sound could not be credited to him, but Thag knew there was a sort of "symphony" taking place; plenty of talented cavepeople involved at all levels. And in any case, even perceptive adults just a all-finger rows back were unsure where the voice came from.</p></div></div>
