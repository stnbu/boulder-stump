# At-Least-For-Now-Secret Notes about /Gog said "Boulder-Stump"!/

Everyone is a caveperson. It's as appropriate to say "cavelady" as it is to say "lady".

The feeling is light and easy like a mockumentary. The narrator is just "me", so I don't have to remember what "voice" I'm using. 

Outline:

Everything is subject to change, eebureetang. But you'll have to retitle if we don't have a smackdown involving Gog's use of the word "boulder-stump" somehow.

## 000 Preface

We meet the Crec and learn about their world. Verk tells a story. It is deeply meaningful for some.

## 001, wherein we learn of Zog's great acumen and fertility

We take the reader back to Zog's early years. Zog current clan leader, and that's why it's called "The Zog clan". Zog was a hero's hero, in other words, lucky he's not dead. He was known for his daring and just kind of /falling into/ situations that make him have the appearance of a total badass. He just happens to be the guy in the good -vs evil movie that throws the rock that seriously wounds the bad guy in the satisfying end. Roll credits. But despite all of his impressive doings, he really only has so much of a clue what's going on. He's not learned to have a look of wonderment when things work out for him. Giving the impression that he meant to do that all along is central to his persona. This means giving some pretty weak and convoluted explanations. We hear the perplexing story of Zog's first dive, and as far as anyone knew, first dive ever in the tar pits. He came off looking like a total stud, but came within seconds of dying about eight different times in the process.

Let's have a from-birth to marriage fastforward, followed by tales of daring from his youth. And of course, displaying, entirely for what it is, his deeply held, more or less random believes that he's willing to club-fight over. Lots of adventures. Lots of badassery.

The lesson? There is a right way to be a Crec. Zog simply exemplifies it.

## 002 wherin, Zog starts studying to become a lawyer (though we have a clever name for it):

Relations:

- Grut, haver of potent seed, starter of epochs. He actually does not have an appendage of any kind to his name. He is "Grut". Not, "Grut The Something". He is as far back as memory goes. He and his only wife Jaar are the founders of what is /now/ called the Zog clan.


Notes:

- No humorous-fake-terms for things that _they_ have and _we_ have a name for. For example, no need to call a tree a "massive-weed" or to call a cat a "gerbil-dog".

Quoth Verk:

<long-ass-quote>
As some of you know, I had a modest part to play in The Battle of the Snake-Meal, which I numbered this morning to be exactly one squirrel-hoard suns ago as of today."

=##= There was a practiced gasp of wonder from the audience.

The smash that was heard 'round the forest, as you know, marked its start, as a Clorp soldier laying in wait smashed the great melon helmet right off of a devoted hero who was guarding our position at Rhino-Scat Hill."

What tipped us off was the crack of his sturdy-gourd-hat splitting in to. I just barely saved his life. From within the our tactical-burrow we could hear the shouts of the hated Clorp coming our way.

# Audience members duifully make faces of disghust at the mention of the name.

My pal Lu and I, we head up to the top of Rhino-Scat, knowing that there was the beginnings of a boulder-rhino being constructed up at the top. I say 'beginnings' only because it wasn't made official yet. It was complete alright, and pointed in exactly the right direction. Lu starts talking to me about which one of us is going to out there to the verge and give their life by unlodging the required stones, there not in that day being the idea yet of just tying a some sturdy twist-vine to it and giving a pull from a safe distance.

I had spied something on the way up and decided to have one over on old Lu. I say, 'well by rights, Lu, even as my friend. You need to be the one to go out there and do this. You know I got a family to support and my new possition at camp comes with a lot of responsibility, one that there just ain't a lot of good replacemnts for. You think for a minute about what old Corporal Bogh would say in this situation. I'm sorry Lu, but I'm thinking of the Forest here. My hand to Ender-Of-All-Questions, this is my thinking, Lu. I'm sorry.

I was in a haste of course, so I let him sit on that for just a short while and was gonna let him in on it, but just then, he got choked up a bit and stiffened and said, 'Private Verk, sir! It has been a priviledge fighting for our home, this Forest along side with you. Friend.'

I saw a tear forming so I figured I should get a move on. Did I mention I was in a hurry?

=##= Laugh

'Lu!', I says, 'Lu I was just having a go at ya pal! I spied a stick on the way up that should be long enough. I'll go back and fetch it! You shoulda seen your face!'

I ran not 60 paces and fetched the stick, and was back in a jiffy.

Lu and I heaved and heaved and oh how that little tree's trunk bent and bent. All at once, we heard a rumble. It we didn't see any of the stay boulders move before we heard it. It was like The Army of Ender-Of-All-Questions himself at full charge!

Brfgf. Bugrgl. Bunjle. Brrrkk.

=##= Verk, in his way, was trying to make sound of a thousand mighty boulders on their way to smite.

I mean these things come crashing down, leveling everything! There were trees a man around that were not just snapped, the were sheered off at the surface, after which their roots were pounded into pulp. The land on that side of the hill is still good for working to this day, and it was only known as Left-morning-sun Rhino-Scat Woods before that. And a woods it was.

Then the rhino started meeting up with the men... and the Clorp.

=##= Verk gave his signature knowing wink, and the audience laughs, nervously.

It went through ranks upon ranks of the Clorp. Leaving a genuine bloody mess. Walking through the aftermath was like seeing a flooded mouse burrow after a good rhino trampling. It is something I will always remember.

Our men jeered mightily, tempered maybe a bit by those of our own who got caught up in the destruction.

=##= The audience collectively gave a pained, but soft groan of regret and some gently pulled on their noses.<footnote: this is a gesture of lament and deep respect for unavoidable sacrifices made.>

And that was the end of The Battle of the Snake-Meal. It really was over just about that fast. We really got lucky, plus, you can be sure, we xxxxhilarious-religious-ritualxxxx

Ephemeral Notes:

- "boys and baby-makers..."
- Someone gets caught using the "bachelor-tree" and is vaguely shamed for it the rest of their life.
- We need to get around to: Gog said "boulder-trunk" and is tried for obscenity and has Grav as his lawyer.
- Somewhere here and there we need to throw in a "very special" episode where someone get's gorily torn apart or beaten to death or thrown off a mountain for something that totally deserves it: man-on-man buttfucking, conning granny, child-diddling... Really shock it to 'em.
- Is there a character that's always trying to make a flying machine and fails over and over in hilarious ways. Is there?!

But what's the plot?

Crecspeak:

Words transliterated from Crecspeak are always hyphenated (or /dashed/), like "father-brother" meaning your father's brother, and not /just/ uncle. The distinction is important to the Crec.

For the English speaking audience, we use the closest equivalent in English to determine capitalization. For example, "Do you have a father-brother?" vs "I saw Father-brother Verk".

Be careful not to over-think the meaning, but it should be apparent from context. The words are chosen from English to best convey the meaning. It may sometimes be hard to understand why certain words were chosen. In these cases we are trying to convey the meaning as a Crec would understand it.

Glossary:

- after-die-monster: Their Devil. Just one, like you.
- ancient-speak: Generally meaning "story-telling", this analogous to selling a book in our times. It is both 1) revered by default 2) kind of, let's face it, not always going to be a big deal. Times change, pops.
- baby-makers: Girls. I am sorry. My job is to bring you this story accurately, including look /and/ feel. This was their world, sorry. But a Crec, or perhaps even any caveperson would have no less respect for a /mere/ baby-maker than you would for say a truck driver or computer technician. It's due its own respect, in their eyes. And everyone gets along, no less than you and your sister did. It's just what's up, that's all. 
- bachelor-tree: A defecate, oddly "chubby" tree that both looks and smells like wedding night. It is also a very delicate topic of conversation among the Crec. Sure, the Amish might know what a vagina /is/, but will somehow manage to go a lifetime without saying it out-loud or acknowledging its existence<footnote: ever, ever, ever> (to reach for a tangible analog you might understand.)
- Battle of the Snake-Meal, The: Without a doubt the most famous battle from The Great Club War, and its turning point in favor of ultimate victory for the Crec.
- between-ham-fire-pebbles: Hemorrhoids, piles.
- bird-scat: Used variously for snot, puss, and, if you are a particularly nasty sort of Crec, semen.
- boulder-rhino: A kind of engine of war that is know by many names in our world. At its simplest (which it usually is), it is a collection of the largest stones that can possibly be hauled to the top of the hill/mountain, restrained by a few smaller rocks that will somehow be swat out of the way at the right time, releasing a thunderous stampede of very big boulders, in the direction of one's enemy, most often.
- boulder-trunk: Here we reach /the/ word around which this entire story orbits. You'll figure it out. It's pretty embarrassing after all.
- Clorp [singular and plural]: TODO: who are then and what makes them tick. They are the "enemy" of the Crec. And a definition.
- club-fight: A kind of duel involving some ceremony. There is a regulatory body <why not name it here> that exists to ensure that any two clubs used in a club-fight are recognized as being "fair". The participants, on the other hand vary widely. The last rule of club-fight, as it is the most important, is: Someone's got to not be able to walk away.
- Crec [singular and plural]: The Forest to which the Zog clan both lives and belongs. "Crec" can refer to the Forest or the people who live there.
- drop-stone: A unit of time; about as long as it takes for a stone to hit the ground when dropped from an outstretched hand, on more or less level ground. They're as tall as you and used to inhibit the same planet. You figure it out.
- elders-quorum: This is a sort of "The Senate" of a Forest (in cases where they have bothered). It's just as inept and entertaining as our analogs (diet, soviet, merikin, parliament, kremlin, house, neighborhood gang...)
- father-brother: Your father's brother. Your "uncle", but with more information.
- food-clay: Shit
- Forest: The largest organizing category of people, analogous to a nation.
- Forest-Deer: A political party (same deal) that composes exactly 50% of the Elders-Quorum (You should now be asking if these are the good ones.)
- juff: An alcoholic beverage made from fermented coconut flesh, and a polite quantity of spit from a special, designated virgin baby-maker, who is chosen yearly as the designated provider of spit (A custom that has been known to ruin some plans.)
- jump-scare: Living in something like a giant ant hill, opportunities to e.g. hide around the corner and scare the food-clay out of someone abound. This is that.
- predict-tool: Probably a good start on the idea of "a hypothesis".
- relax-marks: Everyone sits on rocks. Some rocks get a lot of mileage. Inevitably there are brown, burnished areas that repel liquids well and indicate a sweet rock to sit on. So there is some tension: On the one hand they are a mark of shame, sloth and bad housekeeping, but on the other hand everyone likes a good sit.
- rhino-calf: It means literally that but is also a term of endearment that you can still say without being too creepy. Like "dear".
- rhino-scat: Mostly known as being the name of a certain hill that was central to the events of The Battle of the Snake Meal during The Great Club War. Actual rhino scat has a certain look. The famous hill has that same look.
- rock-stick: Referring to the cavemen sex organs, it has a slightly less "rude" sense than do other profanities. It's equivalent to the modern (circa 2021) English "weener" or "peener" or "willy" or "pee-pee" or "jiggly bits" or "hookie" or "wee-wee" or "peter".
- several-finger: A quantity of something. It is exactly 10. The number of fingers you have. Like "dozen" but two less.
- sit-ham: Butt-cheek
- sit-ham-stone: Chair
- snake-meal: A "bump", "lump", "protuberance", "hump", or area of fattening. Also used in the way we say, "love handles".
- soot-pallet: Wherever fire has deposited soot on an area of stone that has been used for writing, if you write in it, it becomes a "soot-pallet". It's as common as and thought of like billboards, but are not thought of as owned, so it's acceptable for someone to write something (proper) on such a sooted stone surface. Trespassing is still a thing, though.
- squirrel-hoard: An abstract quantity meaning "a lot", if you thought "a whole bunch of" you'd be close.
- sun-palm: A unit of time. The amount of time it takes for the sun to pass the width of one palm at arm's length. For example, if you want to know what-in-the-morning it is, hold your right arm out straight, rotate your upturned hand counter clockwise 90 degrees so that your fingers are pointing to your left, the distance from top of your hand (the outer [upper-most] part of the first knuckle of the pinkie) to the bottom of your hand (the outer [lower-most] part of the first knuckle of your index finger) is the unit you use to measure the hight of the son. A Crec will say, "It's 7 sun-palm from dawn, get a move on!"
- take-money: Shorthand for take-part-money. Take-money also means "robbery" or "mugging", but the Crec universally do not make the connection.
- take-part-money: A tax.
- value-stone: A unique, hopefully big, visually appealing gem or mineral (there are many sources.) They are the currency, but their relative value is determined at haggling time, which makes for double the arguments.
