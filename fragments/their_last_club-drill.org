Club-drill was excruciating in the Grav and Gog in ways that they couldn't manage to communicate to others. It was mostly about being told what to do and criticized by the ignorant and linear thinkers that were inevitably the "top bronze".

Another concept they couldn't explain nor even know of its existence is "selection bias". It's a subtle idea. It would be a while before that idea got identified and tagged.

In words that a Crec might understand: The cavemen who made their way to the top in the hierarchy were the type who really liked bossing people about, the wisdom of their plans for you was not part of their calculations. Given enough cavemen, you will find some outliers. You may not know anyone who likes to give orders, doesn't like to be questioned, and doesn't care whether they are "right" by /your/ definition. But how many CO's[fn:: Caveman Officer] do we need? Not many. And they'll find their way toward their dream job. Everyone should. Recruiting was no small part of the Armed-Forest. Outreach, recruitment and other kinds of advertising paid off in organization growth, as it is meant to do.

You could and probably would some day be drafted. But to make a career out of it was a different tack. If you were not a CO, you pretty much spent all your time learning to kill or killing. They were more the managerial type.

And so, since your fate, if a man, was to be involved in all this anyway, /completely voluntary/ "club-drill" was held in locations around the Forest. They were usually overseen by some Great Bear war hero, and the training ground nearest Bhorv Zolk was Choh-Ov, surrounded by a kind of suburb called Fayt-Caves, was run by Verk. The title of this role, the camp head, was Mother Bear[fn:: Absolutely no one saw a hint of humor or absurdity in this title. Yes, it was well known that mother bears are female, but mother bears were fierce as monkey-business.]. Verk was Choh-Ov's Mother Bear.

Fayt-Caves was a shanty town, but made out of rock, which really looks nicer than shanty, any way you cut it. The settlement surrounding Choh-Ov was seedy, crime-ridden, full of loud parties on an ongoing basis, had an entire district devoted to hire-baby-makers and their trade. Choh-Ov was more or less at the very center of this fried egg of empty calories.

And it was small-knowledge[fn:: 'small[-one]-knowledge': common sense, widely known.] that this was the arrangement surrounding more or less every training camp <-xxx in the Forest and its protectorates. No one thought this amiss. It was small-knowledge.

Grav and Gog had decided to leave the day after the revelation of Ender's-Sword giving them the opportunity to take make a leisurely day of it, needing only to cover 2 all-finger palm of pretty standard jungle, with the way well traveled and therefor clearly marked, well serviced by vendors, and safe-with-many. They had even let themselves sleep in a bit. Since the final part of a journey crossed a wide, flat, scrubby plane and the moon was sufficiently bright, they would be able to walk for hours after dark set in.

In the worst case, they planned to bevvy one night, wake up early and arrive at the Choh-Ov before reveille <-xxx.

As Bhorv Zolk faded into the distance, the path to the morning-sun-left-back-side was gently rolling hills and low shrubs for several palm. Bhorv Zolk could be seen fading into the distance, which was a nice way to say goodbye to home. One got a feeling that it was very big, visible from all this way, and would therefor surely be there when you got back.

Gog hummed, whistled and yipped an improvised song, that Grav didn't really want to admit was actually pretty good.

He'd worked on convincing Gog to have a visit with Kapitle, the music-scratcher nearest Bhorv Zolk. Business was good and all number of copy-protection[fn:: explain!!] schemes were the key to success, Kapitle knew[fn:: But would not share.] He had a regular rotation of all-finger-and throat-and-drum-choirs that would snare[fn:: As in the impromptu bush trap. Their word for "kill at" or "really make a killing".] his most profitable demographic: all-finger-and boys trying to woo their crush by performing some music or other, using /his/ scratching standards and training system.

Sell the materials needed to perform a cover of the latest hit was really all their was in the music business, outside of performing of course.

Grav just enjoyed the well selected traveling music and thought a lot about how to best navigate the next few days, not for any particular reason other than one should plan ahead always, he thought.

Would word have gotten out? Verk would not be at the camp, not feeling any particular need to be there. He would make his way back eventually, at his own pace.

A few palm outside of Fayt-Caves, Verk owned what would be considered a castle almost universally; a point that the men would pass today, if they kept their pace.

"Would word of the Ender's-Sword have made it to Choh-Ov?", Grav wondered allowed.

Without breaking his stride, Gog abruptly stopped his music and looked at Grav, possibly thinking, or possibly for superb comedic timing.

"You mean Ender's-Stump?"

Grav's walk became a staggering, rhythmic stomp as he laughed maniacally while continuing to walk. He eventually gave up on that and let himself fall into an enormous healthy, dark-pruple heather shrub. He continued to laugh face-down at the dirt and detritus at the ancient shrub's base.

He eventually righted himself, making a lot of noise as he pushed himself up, snapping small branches and spitting out the various blooms and twigs that ended up in his open mouth.

"Scout[fn:: "Dude!!"], you need to lay off of that stuff! Not everyone is as mirth-filled as us, you know. The Forest Executioners are not known for their stoatishness[fn:: Sillyness].", said Grav.

"Eegh. I'm tired of worrying about it, to be frank." Gog was such an artist with his banana-language that he was no longer entertained by it, and so was laughing not at all. It seemed like he just thought of it as his 'job'â€”trudging through another day of saying things that caused others to nearly have a stroke with hilarity.

"I mean, yeah, of course I will always take reasonable precautions. But mount it, it becomes so much of a drain on me to constantly have to edit my words, that I'm willing to be a bit 'strategically reckless' in order to just relax for a /sewing/ change!!" Gog seemed to be shaking his head in disgust.

"They /are/ just words, aren't they?", said Gog, sharing some of Gog's annoyance at the arbitrariness of it all. Though, he was not yet an angry rebel like Gog. "It angers me too. Some things are at the same time both infuriatingly stupid and unjust, while at the same time being completely small-knowledge to seemingly everyone."

Grav continued. "Did you know that in XXX you can have three toenails pulled out for underpaying your take-money? Regardless of circumstances? At least the Crec haven't gone that crazy.

If you find something in the jungle of any value at all, the XXX 'claim' on half of it, without any kind of justification. It's just /theirs/ and that's that!"

with hastily, poorly-appointed row after row of little hills, with a kind of crash pad of a cave.
