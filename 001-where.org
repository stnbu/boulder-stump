>>>> Gog and Grav are going to tromp around in the woods aimlessly with the stated goal of xxx

>>>> Grav is getting ready to go out and meet Gog xxsomewhere-interestingxx and from there go on their adventures.

>>>> Verk is staying in the burrow two burrows away from Grav and inevitably they meet in the morning xxsomewhere-definitely-no-others-hearxx

>>>> Verk is a completely different person in these situations and Grav lets his mind wander to examples, remembers the past. and the perplexity of it.

>>>> Verk in his almost "evil" demanor, jabs at Grav as he prepares. Makes finger-fucky insinuations about what he and Gog are going to be doing out in the woods today.

>>>> Grav is cool on the outside but red-hot on the inside: he contemplates the tension between "we must publicly worship verk" (and so he cannot even relate this kind of stuff to others) and the sense that he's getting a "talking to" about things he has not done and knows that he's not allowed to defend himself.

>>>> Grav relates horrifying story of younger, stronger Verk going monkey-scat over some trivial thing that Grav said to Verk. It was scary as fuck, and so we relate it as such. Grav was one of all-finger and three years (what is a "year"?) old.

>>>> And now Grav is traumatized into never disagreeing with Verk either privately or publicly.

>>>> Grav finally breaks free and meets up with Gog for xxx (figure it out). Along the way they meet some interesting characters and generally have a great time. The first person they meet is one of all-finger old at that point we reveal Grav and Gog's age.
