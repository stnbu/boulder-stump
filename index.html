    <h3>Ado</h3>
    <p>Hi. Welcome to my terrible web page about my awesome book entitled, <strong><em>Gog Said &#8220;Boulder-Stump&#8221;</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>It's silly. <em>I</em> am silly. Relax, bro. We all need a good mocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doing my honest level best to be objective and calibrated about my own abilities, I would say that this book is various parts of...
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Discworld</li>
      <li>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</li>
      <li>Galaxy Quest</li>
      <li>Full Metal Jacket</li>
      <li>Clan of the Cave Bear</li>
      <li>Caveman (1981)</li>
      <li>Monty Python</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You get it. Nothing special.</p>

      So far I've just been spraying out other content. Will get around to it. And a proper prolog, probably. And all kinds of restructuring.</p>
    <p>A GitHub repo that corresponds more or less to this content is here. And I totally will take fucking pull requests. I'll make all kinds of opinionated changes until it's unrecognizable, take credit for it definitely remember to thank you.
    </p>
    <p>I guess it's a "living document". May there not be a bunch of idiotic contraversy about "Chapter II". Relax, dummies.</p>
    <p>I also have a lot of terrifically random content <a href="https://mburr.bearblog.dev/blog/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.publish0x.com/@captainmidday">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/captainmidday">here</a>. Judge not, lest I un-friend you and pout.</p>
